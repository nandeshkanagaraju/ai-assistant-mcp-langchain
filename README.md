# AI Assistant MCP

An interactive AI chat assistant built using **MCPAgent** with **LangChain**, **OpenAI GPT-4**, and **conversation memory**.  
This assistant can answer queries, remember previous messages, and provide structured responses, including formatted outputs with colored terminal messages.

---

## Features

- **Interactive Chat**: Chat with the assistant in a terminal session.
- **Memory-Enabled**: Remembers previous queries and responses for contextual conversations.
- **Formatted Output**: Clean, readable terminal outputs with separators and numbering.
- **Colored Output**: Uses `colorama` to distinguish user messages, assistant messages, and system info.
- **Tool Restrictions**: Disables potentially unsafe tools (`file_system`, `network`) for safe execution.
- **Search & Recommendation Tools**: Can use MCP-enabled tools like search to find restaurants, hotels, etc.
